"""Transition learning between adjacent areas.

Phase 3 of the adjacent-areas feature (discussion #431). Walks each area's
occupied-interval timeline once per analysis cycle and counts area-to-area
transitions, bucketed by hour-of-week (0..167, weekday × 24 + hour). Two
chain depths are recorded per transition into the same ``AreaTransitions``
table:

* 1-hop ``X → Y``: stored with ``mid_area=""``.
* 2-hop ``W → X → Y``: stored with ``mid_area=X``, only when the prior
  ``W → X`` transition itself fits within the trajectory window.

Only transitions where every link is a configured-adjacent pair are
counted, so the table stays sparse and irrelevant pairs (rooms that aren't
physically connected in the user's installation) don't pollute the model.

Counts are exponentially decayed each cycle by
``ADJACENCY_RECENCY_HALF_LIFE_DAYS`` so the model adapts to changing
household patterns. Transitions older than the last full pipeline run are
not re-counted (we track ``last_observed_end_time`` per entry in the
``Metadata`` table); only the new tail since the last run is observed.

This module does **not** read from ``AreaTransitions`` — that's the
Phase 4 lookup path. Diagnostics consumers can however inspect what was
recorded via :func:`summarize_transitions_for_diagnostics`.
