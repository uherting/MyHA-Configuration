# ─────────────────────────── Active-state resolution ────────────────────────────
#
# Issue #520: the stored-interval ("ground truth") path and the live-evidence
# path must agree on which states count as *occupied*, or the learned prior
# and the running probability describe different rooms.
#
# They did not. ``build_presence_query`` derived its occupied-state set from
# ``DEFAULT_TYPES`` while ``Entity.evidence`` reads the area's configured
# states, so a user who removed ``paused`` from ``CONF_MEDIA_ACTIVE_STATES``
# still had every ``paused`` stretch counted as occupancy ground truth. A
# media player parked in ``paused`` for days drove ``global_prior`` to the
# 0.99 clamp while live evidence correctly read ~0.01.
#
# The fix is to resolve active states the way ``EntityType`` does — the area's
# configured list when non-empty, the type default otherwise — from one shared
# helper, so the two paths cannot drift apart again.
# ``resolve_active_states``/``area_active_states_by_type`` answer this from the
# area config (well-defined even for a type with no entity loaded);
# ``entity_active_states`` answers it per entity from the live ``Entity``
# objects, which is what ``db.sync`` needs when deciding whether a recorded
# state was active for the entity that reported it.
