"""Shadow-mode online global-prior estimator (DB-retirement epic, #500).

Production computes the global prior by replaying motion intervals from
the sidecar SQLite database every hour:

    global_prior = clamp(occupied_seconds / (now - first_interval_start))

This module maintains the same ratio as **sufficient statistics updated
incrementally** — an occupied-seconds accumulator fed from live motion
evidence at the coordinator's tick cadence, and the first-observation
timestamp as the period anchor. If the online value tracks the
DB-computed value on real homes, the raw-interval replay (and eventually
the database itself) is unnecessary for prior learning.

Shadow-mode contract: the online value is computed, persisted (HA
storage helper), diffed against the DB value each analysis cycle, and
exported in diagnostics. It is **never read by the probability path**.
Promotion routes through #500's 30-day shadow-diff gate.

Known, accepted approximations vs the DB path (they bound the expected
diff; see #500 step 2 for how the diff is judged):

* **Sampling**: occupied time accrues in tick-sized quanta from live
  presence evidence (piecewise-constant between ticks), vs the DB's
  exact interval boundaries replayed from the recorder. Ticks are not
  perfectly uniform — see ``coordinator._record_shadow_tick`` and
  ``_handle_decay_timer`` for how a steady cadence is maintained even
  when decay is disabled for every area.
* **No motion-timeout extension**: the DB path extends each motion
  interval by the area's motion timeout during merging; the online
  numerator does not, so it reads slightly low on areas with sparse
  motion.
* **Retention**: the DB period re-anchors as old intervals are pruned
  (365-day retention); the online period anchor is fixed at first
  observation. Irrelevant inside the 30-day shadow window.

The numerator's presence definition mirrors
``db.queries.get_occupied_intervals``'s ground truth — motion ∪ media ∪
sleep evidence, not motion alone (see the ``observe`` caller in
``coordinator.py``) — so the two paths are measuring the same thing
modulo the two approximations above.
