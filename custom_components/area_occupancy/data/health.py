"""Sensor and pipeline health monitoring for Area Occupancy Detection.

Two families of checks are run per area:

- **Sensor health** — per-entity anomalies (stuck active/inactive,
  unavailable, never-triggered).
- **Pipeline health** — per-area calculation anomalies (priors haven't
  trained, occupied-intervals cache is stale, last analysis cycle was
  slow, correlation analysis is failing for too many sensors).

Both surfaces emit Home Assistant repair issues with distinct
translation-key namespaces (``sensor_health_*`` vs ``pipeline_health_*``)
and share the same ``HealthIssue`` shape so callers (e.g. diagnostics)
can iterate them uniformly.
