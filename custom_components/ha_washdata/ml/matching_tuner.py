"""On-device tuning of the matcher's scoring weights (Stage 4/5, opt-in).

Mirrors the offline ``devtools/dtw_ab_eval.py`` methodology but as a shippable,
NumPy-only, executor-safe pure function: it does leave-one-out matching over the
device's own labelled cycles, sweeps a small grid of the highest-impact scoring
weights (corr/MAE split, duration agreement weight, energy agreement weight, and
DTW ensemble weight independently), and - only if a candidate beats the shipped
defaults on a HELD-OUT split by a margin - returns a per-device config override. The caller persists it; the matcher reads it live
and falls back to the const defaults otherwise.

Discipline (same as model promotion): tune on a train split, gate on a held-out
split, require a margin, cap the grid to bounded scoring weights (never
structural behaviour). This guards against over-fitting the small, partly
manually-labelled per-user cycle set.

    Mirrors production: ``profile_store`` resamples the current cycle with
    ``resample_adaptive`` and then re-grids every candidate to that same
    ``used_dt`` via ``_get_cached_sample_segment``, so index *i* is the same
    elapsed time on both sides.

    **The template follows production's three-way rule, in production's order**
    (`ProfileStore.async_match_profile`), which is register item 356 closing item
    347(e): a pinned golden cycle's own sharp trace, else the DTW-warped ENVELOPE
    AVERAGE once the pool holds >= 2 cycles, else the single representative
    sample - which is also the safety net when an envelope will not build. The
    middle branch is the common case, and it is the one that used to be missing:
    scoring one representative cycle where live matching scores the envelope
    average can favour weights that win on a trace nothing is matched against.

    **Cost, and the trap inside it.** An envelope is built from traces, so it does
    not depend on the weights being tuned and survives the whole grid search plus
    every holdout call; and leave-one-out excludes exactly ONE cycle, so only the
    target's own profile gets a different template while every other profile
    keeps the full-pool one, shared by every target. Distinct templates are
    therefore `profiles + targets`, not `folds x profiles` - measured on the worst
    real export in `cycle_data/` (12 profiles with >= 2 cycles, 63 targets), 75
    templates at 79 ms a DTW warp, ~5.9 s one-off. **That figure only holds if the
    cache outlives one `_top1` call.** It did not at first: `_top1` built a fresh
    cache and is called ~59 times (1 base + 48 grid + 10 holdout), which measured
    16.1 s -> 360.6 s on a real export. Hence the `cache` argument threaded
    through the whole run - nothing in it depends on `cfg`. Do not re-scope it.

    The cheap approximation (averaging the pool's regridded curves without the
    DTW warp) is measured WORSE and is not what `_envelope_avg` does.

    The exposure is bounded regardless: `tune_matching_config` can
    only move the bounded scoring weights, never structural matching behaviour,
    `revert_matching_config` undoes it, and promotion is gated on **held-out
    top-1 accuracy**: `tune_matching_config` promotes only when the tuned config
    beats the baseline by `margin` on at least `min_wins` of `n_splits` held-out
    subsamples (4 of 5) AND the mean held-out top-1 gain is itself >= `margin`.
    Not AUC - no AUC is computed anywhere in this module. The AUC gate in
    CLAUDE.md is `ML_TRAINING_AUC_MARGIN`, which governs the ml/ CLASSIFIERS in
    `training_task.py` and has nothing to do with the matcher's scoring weights.
