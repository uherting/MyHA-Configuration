Summary
-------
This README contains hints and information how to handle customisations
based on more than one component.

Fast track:
    - Start the bash shell in the container
        -> docker exec -it `docker ps | grep esphome | cut -f 1 -d " "` bash
        as in custom_components_dev/../../shell_scripts/docker_hashell_esphome.sh
    - Run the script in the bash shell of the container
      `find / -type d -name custom_components_dev`/../../shell_scripts/docker_esphome_components_dev_to_esphome_base.sh
      ==> /config/esphome/custom_components_dev/../../.....
General
-------
* The dir containing this README is for developing components which consist
    of more than one component (configcontained in/esphome/custom_components_dev).
    An example in ESPHome base would be the platform uln20003 which is based on
    the stepper component.

Docker
------
Task: copy components from config/esphome/custom_components_dev to the directory
esphome/components which is part of the container.

- A aka 'step by step'
    - accessing docker container via the shell
        - getting the id of the docker container
            -> docker ps | grep -e "CONTAINER ID" -e esphome
        - executing a bash shell in the container
            -> docker exec -it <id of the container> bash
        - a little helper: alias ll (should be available in bash)
            -> alias ll='ls -alF'
        - copying is not described here as it is too error prone
- B - aka 'the fast approach'
    - finding the ESPHome directories required
        - starting the shell ina container whoose id changes by design
          (defining an alias is not necessary as of 20210222_134400)
            -> docker exec -it `docker ps | grep esphome | cut -f 1 -d " "` bash
        - find THE esphome component directory
            -> find / -type d -name components | grep "/opt"
        - find the esphome custom_components directory
            -> find / -type d -name custom_components_dev
        - copying is not described here as it is too error prone
- C - aka 'the even faster approach'
    - see "fast track" above

Directory locations in the docker container
-------------------------------------------
- MyHAconfiguration repository: esphome/custom_components_dev
- docker container: /opt/.../components
    - this is the dir which needs to contain symlinks to all dirs located
